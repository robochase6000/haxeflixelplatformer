# Mode

started with the Mode tutorial by [Adam Atomic](http://adamatomic.com/), which was an early demo for Flixel.

You can play the original Mode [here](http://www.flixel.org/mode/) and view the source code for that [here](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/Mode) if you'd like to compare the two.

In this example, I've made some tweaks to the game more to my liking, including -
1. on the fly level editing by clicking the mouse on tiles
2. vastly improved virtual controller
3. ...more to come
